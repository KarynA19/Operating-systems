# Custom Shell Project in C

In this project, I created a custom Shell program in C, running on Ubuntu (UNIX). The Shell supports various commands, including basic Linux commands, mathematical operations, logic operations, and string manipulations.

### Technologies Used:
- **C**: For implementing the Shell and handling system calls.
- **fork & exec**: For process management.
- **Linux system calls**: For file operations like `open`, `read`, and `write`.

### Features:
- **StandShell**: Supports basic Linux commands (e.g., `mkdir`, `grep`, `ls`).
- **MathShell**: Performs mathematical operations like square root, power, and solving quadratic equations.
- **LogicShell**: Handles logic operations such as converting decimal to binary/hex and counting set bits.
- **StringShell**: Performs string operations like printing file content, searching text, and replacing words.

### Submission:
The project includes C files for each shell type and a script (`Sys_shell.sh`) to compile and run all the components.
